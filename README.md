# Irrigation Monitoring System

This project is an irrigation monitoring dashboard that displays real-time data on moisture levels and temperatures. The data is fetched from a backend server, which can be updated using a simple API call. This dashboard can serve as a starting point for a more advanced irrigation management system or smart agriculture platform.

## Project Structure:

- **Backend (`app.py`):** A Flask application that provides API endpoints to update and retrieve data.
- **Frontend (`templates/index.html`):** A web dashboard displaying the latest readings, a data table of recent readings, and a time-series chart visualizing the moisture and temperature data.

## Features:

1. **Real-time Data Visualization:** The dashboard fetches the latest data from the backend every 10 seconds and updates the display.
2. **Easy Data Input:** The backend supports a simple API endpoint that allows updating the moisture and temperature readings.
3. **Modern UI:** The dashboard is designed with a modern look and feel, utilizing the Bootstrap framework and custom CSS styles.

## How to Run:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required packages using pip:
   ```
   pip install flask
   ```
4. Run the Flask application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost`.
6. To update the readings, you can use a simple curl command:
   ```
   curl "http://localhost/update?moisture=[YOUR_MOISTURE_VALUE]&temperature=[YOUR_TEMPERATURE_VALUE]"
   ```
   Replace `[YOUR_MOISTURE_VALUE]` and `[YOUR_TEMPERATURE_VALUE]` with your desired values.

## Code Explanation:

- **Backend (`app.py`):**
  - The Flask application has three main routes:
    - `/`: Renders the main dashboard.
    - `/update`: Accepts GET requests with `moisture` and `temperature` parameters to update the readings.
    - `/get_data`: Returns a JSON response with the stored data for rendering on the dashboard.
  - The data is temporarily stored in an in-memory list, which can be replaced with a database for persistent storage.

- **Frontend (`templates/index.html`):**
  - The dashboard is divided into three sections: latest readings, a data chart, and a table of recent readings.
  - It uses Chart.js for data visualization and jQuery for asynchronous data fetching.
  - The `fetchData` function retrieves data from the backend, updates the display, and redraws the chart.

## Future Enhancements:

1. Add more sensors and data points.
2. Implement persistent storage using a database.
3. Integrate with IoT devices for automatic data input.
4. Add alert mechanisms for critical readings.
